## 📌 Project Description

This project uses supervised machine learning to recommend the **most suitable crops and fertilisers** based on key soil and environmental parameters. It aims to assist farmers in maximizing yield, ensuring sustainable use of resources, and reducing input costs through predictive analytics.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 **Crop Recommendation**  
  Predicts the ideal crop to grow based on input features like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH, and rainfall.

- 🧪 **Fertiliser Recommendation**  
  Identifies nutrient imbalances and suggests appropriate fertilisers.

- 🌦️ **Weather Data Integration (Optional)**  
  Uses live weather data to refine predictions (via OpenWeatherMap API).

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard (Optional)**  
  Streamlit-based UI for data input, visualization, and recommendation output.
